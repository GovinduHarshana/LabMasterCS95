  - question: "01. What is the flame color of sodium ions (Na\u207A)?"
    answers:
    - A) Lilac
    - B) Bright yellow
    - C) Blue-green
    - D) Crimson red
    correctAnswerIndex: 1
    explanation: "Answer: B) Bright yellow.   Explanation: Sodium (Na\u207A) gives
      a characteristic intense yellow flame due to strong emission of light at around
      589 nm."
  - question: 02. Which of the following metal ions does NOT produce a visible flame
      color?
    answers:
    - A) Magnesium
    - B) Lithium
    - C) Calcium
    - D) Sodium
    correctAnswerIndex: 0
    explanation: "Answer: A) Magnesium.   Explanation: Magnesium (Mg\xB2\u207A) does
      not produce a visible flame color in a standard flame test because its emitted
      light is in the UV range, which is not visible to the naked eye."
  - question: 03. Which of the following metal ions produces a deep red (crimson)
      flame?
    answers:
    - A) Sodium
    - B) Potassium
    - C) Strontium
    - D) Copper
    correctAnswerIndex: 2
    explanation: "Answer: C) Strontium.   Explanation: Strontium (Sr\xB2\u207A) gives
      a deep red (crimson) flame, commonly used in fireworks to produce red colors."
  - question: 04. Why do different elements emit different colors in a flame test?
    answers:
    - A) Different elements have different numbers of protons
    - B) Different elements have different electron energy levels
    - C) Different elements have different melting points
    - D) Different elements react differently with oxygen
    correctAnswerIndex: 1
    explanation: 'Answer: B) Different elements have different electron energy levels.  
      Explanation: Each element has unique electron energy levels, so when electrons
      return to their original state, they release light of specific wavelengths,
      producing distinct colors.  '
  - question: 05. Why is the flame test not always a reliable method for identifying
      metal ions?
    answers:
    - A) Some metals do not produce visible colors
    - B) Sodium contamination can mask other colors
    - C) Different metal ions may produce similar colors
    - D) All of the above
    correctAnswerIndex: 3
    explanation: 'Answer: D) All of the above.   Explanation: The flame test has
      several limitations, including weak or similar colors, sodium interference,
      and invisibility of certain flame colors.'
