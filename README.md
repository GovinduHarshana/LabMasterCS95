## üéØ Project Overview

**LabMaster** is a virtual lab simulator designed to deliver immersive and interactive Physics and Chemistry practical experiences for Sri Lankan Advanced Level (A/L) science students. It addresses the lack of physical laboratory access by providing digital alternatives aligned with the local curriculum.

---

## üß† Problem Statement

Many A/L science students in Sri Lanka lack access to adequate lab facilities, materials, and in-person demonstrations. As a result, crucial practical knowledge is often limited to board drawings and theory-based instruction. This makes it difficult for students to visualize experiments and fully grasp scientific concepts.

---

## ‚úÖ Our Solution

**LabMaster** bridges the gap by providing:

- Interactive 2D simulations of Physics and Chemistry practicals
- Guided experiment walkthroughs
- Real-time note-taking
- Progress tracking and performance feedback
- Timed quizzes to reinforce learning

It is accessible on web and desktop platforms, empowering students and teachers to explore practical science anytime, anywhere.
